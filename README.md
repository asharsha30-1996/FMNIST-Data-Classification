# FMNIST-Data-Classification
Unleashing Machine Learning Models for Image Classification on the FMISNT Dataset

We explored the application of machine learning models, including dimensionality reduction techniques, on the Fashion-MNIST (FMNIST) dataset. While the MNIST dataset has been widely successful, the increased complexity of FMNIST, with diverse classes representing fashion items, offers a more challenging benchmark.

The study leverages machine learning models for image classification on FMNIST, employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction. Notably, XGBoost applied to PCA-reduced data with tuned hyperparameters outperforms other models, such as Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), achieving an 88% accuracy on the test dataset
